# Administer Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement

Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement administrators can use the Dynamics 365 admin center (<https://port.crm.dynamics.com/G/manage/index.aspx>) to manage the environment and settings. Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement admin content is available at [Administrator Guide for Dynamics 365 apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/admin-guide).

> [!NOTE]
> In some documentation, we previously referred to Dynamics 365 (online) when we were talking more specifically about Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement applications (apps). We have changed this in our current documentation so that it’s clear when we are referring to the collection of apps that include Sales, Customer Service, Marketing, Field Service, Project Service Automation, and their related services rather than the whole Dynamics 365 product family of applications and services, which includes Finance and Operations, Talent, Retail, and Business Central. You may still see “Dynamics 365 (online)” in some user interfaces (UI). Those strings refer to Dynamics 365 apps. 

The content from the Customer Engagement admin guide is transitioning to the Power Platform admin guide as settings and features migrate to the Power Platform Admin center. Until the move to the Power Platform Admin center is complete, you’ll still be able to manage settings in Customer Engagement as usual.

For example, many of these admin settings in the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement web client...

...are moving here.

![Environment settings](media/environment-settings-mini.png)

Use links on this page to manage organization-wide settings. App-specific settings will remain in the Dynamics 365 apps, and will be accessed through the respective app settings. More information about managing environment settings in the Power Platform Admin center: [Manage environment settings](admin-settings.md)
