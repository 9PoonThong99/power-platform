# Administer Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The [Administrator Guide for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/admin-guide) is the original content for managing admin settings and features for Customer Engagement. The content there is transitioning to the PowerApps content as settings and features migrate to the Power Platform Admin center.
