# Administer Power Platform 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With the merge of Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps and the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement platform, we're launching a new admin center experience bringing PowerApps, Flow, and Dynamics 365 administration management together in a single site: the **Power Platform Admin center**. More information in this blog post: [Introducing the Power Platform admin center](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2018/09/25/introducing-the-power-platform-admin-center/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Power Platform admin center is currently in *public preview*, and we are constantly adding features from PowerApps, Flow, and Dynamics 365 admin centers to the new admin center.
