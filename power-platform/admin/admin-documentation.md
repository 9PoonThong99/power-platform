# Preview: Administer Power Platform 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Power Platform Admin center** provides a unified portal for administrators to manage environments and settings for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement, PowerApps, and Microsoft Flow.
