# Common Data Service analytics 

We've improved how you view metrics for your organization. You no longer need to install or update a solution. Instead, you can view Customer Data Service analytics right from the Power Platform Admin center to quickly view adoption ad user metrics for your organization. 

Admins with the following roles can view Customer Data Service analytics:
- Office 365 global admins
- Dynamics 365 service admins
- Power Platform service admins
- Environment admins

 **Key highlights**  

- **Deprecating the solution**: Organization Insights, available as a preferred solution from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.04931187-431c-415d-8777-f7f482ba8095?tab=Overview), will no longer be supported or available for use in future releases.  

- **Deprecating Organization Insights dashboard**: This dashboard will be removed from Common Data Service in future releases. 

- **Monitor adoption and use**: Identify your most active users, the number and types of operations theyâ€™re performing, number of pages requests, most-used entities, workflows, plug-ins, and more, over a period of time as you work toward your adoption goals.  

- **Manage storage and performance**: Monitor storage quotas, storage use, and top tables by size to optimize performance.  

- **Troubleshoot effectively**: Drill down into the details of your top failing workflows and API calls to quickly diagnose and troubleshoot errors.

 Consider the following about the Customer Data Service analytics calendar:  

- The Calendar control is not available for the  Storage dashboard and not applicable to any storage related chart as only the latest information is shown for those charts.  

- Default time range is shown for the past 48 hours.  

- Data is only shown for the applied time range.  

- Data is available from the time of release of the solution in AppSource, and will be retained for 30 days.  

- Data is shown for time series at an hourly aggregation interval.  

- The data shown for a hourly aggregation interval represents the whole hour. For example, if the number of active users at 2:00 PM is 5, there were 5 active users between 1:00 and 2:00 PM.
