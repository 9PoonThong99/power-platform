# Assign a business unit a different parent business

[!INCLUDE [cc-settings-moving](../includes/cc-settings-moving.md)]

2. Choose **Business Units**.  
  
3. Choose to select the business unit you want to change the settings for.  
  
4. On the Actions toolbar, choose **More Actions** > **Change Parent Business**.  
  
5. In the **Change Parent Business** dialog box, in the New parent business text box, type part or all of the name of the parent business you want to assign the business unit to, and then choose the **Click to select a value for New parent business** icon  ![Lookup button](media/lookup-4.gif "Lookup button").  
  
6. Select the record for the parent business you want to assign the business unit to, and then click **OK**.
