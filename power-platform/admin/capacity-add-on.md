# Preview: Capacity add-ons

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

If your organization has purchased capacity add-ons, you have to allocate that capacity to any environment where you want to use it. You also have to make sure that your users have access to those environments and have the correct permissions before they can use the products for which you've purchased a capacity add-on.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Capacity is allocated to environments, not to individual users. To provide capacity to a specific user, you have to allocate capacity to an environment where that user has access. 

## View capacity add-ons in Power Platform Admin center

If your organization has purchased capacity add-ons, an **Add-ons** tile appears on the Capacity screen in the Power Platform Admin center. Sign into the Admin center, and select **Analytics > Capacity** in the left-side navigation pane.

The **Add-ons** tile shows summary information about the capacity add-ons that your organization has.

Each capacity has a usage gauge that shows how many units have been assigned compared to the available capacity. Capacities are measured in different ways depending on the product. For example, App passes are assigned individually, while AI Builder capacity is measured in credits. Refer to the product documentation for more information about metering.
