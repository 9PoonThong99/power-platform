# Preview: Capacity and storage

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To align with the new business model changes announced here, we have updated our current storage analytics to provide further clarity to our customers. Here is a summary of changes in storage analytics.

- A brand new Capacity Analytics is launched in Power Platform Admin center Analytics.
-	Admins can visualize the data stored in Database, Files, and Logs. 
-	Entitlement information is added to clearly understand what is your tenant available capacity.  
-	Existing customers get new types of capacity (File and Log) but are not impacted by the change until renewal. 

The new storage model provides a single place to view your capacity data.

In the current storage model, you view information in multiple places.

## About the new storage model

We're optimizing data management for database storage, attachments, and audit Logs. There will now be three types of storage: Database, File, and Log.

![](media/storage-model-evolution.png "Evolution of data management")

Some of the benefits of this change: 

- Scalability with purpose-built storage management solutions
- Ability to enable new business scenarios
- Reduced need to free up storage
- Support for variety of data types
- Additional default and full user entitlements
- Flexibility to create new environments/instances 

## Timeline

## FAQ

### I'm an existing customer with an EA agreement. Should I go buy Log and File capacity?
If you have an existing agreement, you are not impacted with the current change. We have added Log and File capacity to your current entitlement which reduces your Database capacity. Until renewal, you can continue with the current plan.

### I'm an existing customer and my renewal is coming up. Will I be impacted?
At renewal, you are expected to move to the new model and purchase the Database, File, and Log capacity as appropriate. You can use the current report to determine how much you should buy.

### Will the Storage tab in Common Data Service continue to work?
The **Storage** tab will be deprecated as we move to the new updated Capacity Analytics.

### I have a PowerApps environment with Database, will this environment count against capacity?
Yes. All Common Data Service environments are counted.

### How do I buy more capacity?
A) ??

### How can I reduce consumed storage space?
