# Preview: Capacity and storage

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

We're introducing a new business model for Common Data Service storage - an evolution of the Common Data Service storage.

The new storage model provides a single place to view your capacity data.

The current storage model had you view information in multiple places.

|Common Data Service for Apps analytics     | ![](media/storage-data-ppac-analytics500.png "storage data")       |
|Organization Insights Dashboard |![](media/storage-data-org-insights500.png "storage data") |

## About the new storage model

We're optimizing data management for database storage, attachments, and audit logs. There will now be three types of storage: database, file, and log.

![](media/storage-model-evolution.png "Evolution of data management")

Some of the benefits of this change: 

- Scalability with purpose-built storage management solutions
- Ability to enable new business scenarios
- Reduced need to free up storage
- Support for variety of data types
- Additional default and full user entitlements
- Flexibility to create new environments/instances 

## Timeline

On April 1, 2019:

- Capacity reporting introduced
- Existing customers get new types of storage but are not impacted by the change until renewal
- Data stored in the organization databases is split and counted in three storage types
- 1GB (minimum) per environment reflected in reporting

## FAQ

Here are some important considerations about the new storage model.

- Pricing changes: link to marketing doc?
- Additional instances: When 1GB of relational database storage is available, no separate license is needed when creating Production and Sandbox instances.
- Increased storage: file and log capacity frees up database capacity. The 4TB size limit does not apply to file and log storage.
- Transition to new platform capacity: No action is required. There is no change to existing forms, views, and other user interface elements. Existing APIs are backwards compatible.
- Anything from Guiding Principles?
