# Capacity and storage

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

We're introducing a new business model for Common Data Service storage - an evolution of the Common Data Service storage capacity.

While storage was once viewed in multiple places...

|Common Data Service for Apps analytics     | ![](media/storage-data-ppac-analytics500.png "storage data")       |
|Organization Insights Dashboard |![](media/storage-data-org-insights500.png "storage data") |

...the new storage model provides a single place to view your data.
