# Responding to Data Subject Rights (DSR) requests for Common Data Service for Apps customer data

## Introduction to DSR requests
The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives rights to people (known in the regulation as *data subjects*) to manage the personal data that's been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the *data controller* or just *controller*). Personal data is defined very broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data subjects the right to do the following, as it pertains to their personal data:

* Obtain copies
* Request corrections
* Restrict processing
* Delete it
* Receive it in electronic format so it can be moved to another controller

A formal request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on his or her personal data is called a Data Subject Rights (DSR) request.

This article describes how Microsoft is preparing for the GDPR, and also provides examples of steps you can take to support GDPR compliance when using PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, and Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps. You'll learn how to use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to help controller customers find, access, and act on personal data in the Microsoft cloud in response to DSR requests.

The following actions are covered in this article:

* **Discover** — Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer data that may be the subject of a DSR request. Once potentially responsive documents are collected, you can perform one or more of the following DSR actions to respond to the request. Alternatively, you may determine that the request doesn't meet your organization’s guidelines for responding to DSR requests.

* **Access** — Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested, make a copy of that data available to the data subject.

* **Rectify** — Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data, where applicable.

* **Restrict** — Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various online services or turning off the desired services where possible. You can also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at another location.

* **Delete** — Permanently remove personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud.

* **Export** — Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable format) of personal data to the data subject.

## CDS for Apps customer data

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Applies to both CDS for Apps and the previous version of Common Data Service

CDS for Apps and the previous version of Common Data Service (CDS) have separate processes for interacting with personal data.

You can identify which type of CDS environment you have by logging into [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and following these steps:

1. In the **Environment** drop-down list, select your environment.
2. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Data**, and then click or tap **Entities**.

    Your environment is CDS for Apps if you see the following entities listed:

    ![PowerApps Entities list](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-entities-list.png)

    Your environment is the previous version of CDS if you see the following entities listed:

    ![PowerApps Legacy Entities list](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-legacy-entities-list.png)

After you determine which type of CDS environment you have, follow the steps in the following sections to identify personal data.

> [!NOTE]
> You may have some environments in CDS for Apps and others in the previous version of CDS, so you'll need to repeat the processes outlined below for each environment in your organization.

## User personal data in CDS for Apps

### Prerequisites
You must create users in the Microsoft 365 admin center and assign them an appropriate user license and security role before they can access and use CDS for Apps.

Standard user personal data (for example, UserName, UserID, Phone, Email, and Address) is kept and maintained in the Microsoft 365 admin center. System administrators can update this personal data only in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and the data is then automatically synced to the CDS for Apps system User entity in all environments. System administrators can also create custom attributes to capture additional user personal data within the CDS for Apps system User entity, and then manually maintain and manage these attributes.

To avoid interruption to business applications that may be critical to your organization’s operations, a user's records are not automatically removed from the CDS for Apps system User entity when that user is deleted from within the Microsoft 365 admin center. The user’s status is set to Disabled in CDS for Apps, but a CDS for Apps System Administrator must locate and remove the user's personal data from CDS for Apps within the application.

Only Office 365 Global Administrators and CDS System Administrators can perform the discover, rectify, export, and delete actions listed below.

### Discover
System Administrators can create multiple CDS for Apps instances. These instances can be used for trial, development, or production purposes. Each of these instances has a copy of the system User entity with any custom attributes that may have been added by the system administrator, as well as the user personal data synced from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

System administrators can find a list of all the CDS for Apps instances by navigating to the Dynamics 365 Administration Center from the PowerApps Admin center.

From the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/), do the following:

1. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then select an environment from the list.

3.	Click or tap **Dynamics 365 Administration Center**.

    ![PowerApps Environment Details](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-environment-details.png)

    A list of all the instances displays.

    ![PowerApps Instance Picker](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-instance-picker.png)

You can find personal data from CDS for Apps users within the following resources:

|Resource | Purpose | Website access | Programmatic access
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| Entity record | Known as the system User entity, it stores a user's personal data. | [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com) | Through the [Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/webapi/update-delete-entities-using-web-api#basic-update)
| Audit history | Allows customers to identify resources that users created, accessed, changed, or deleted at an entity level. | [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com) | Through the [Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/webapi/update-delete-entities-using-web-api#basic-update)

#### User
User personal data is stored in the Azure Active Directory and is automatically synced to all CDS for Apps environments. System administrators cannot update this personal data directly in CDS for Apps while the user is active&mdash;they must update the data from within the Office 365 Administration Center. System administrators can add personal data (for example, custom attributes) directly to CDS for Apps, but they must manually manage this data.

To find a user and his or her personal data, go to the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/) and do the following:

1. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then select an environment from the list.

2. Click or tap **Dynamics 365 Administration Center**, select an environment from the list, and then click or tap **Open**.

3. Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

4. Enter the name of the user in the **Search** box, and then click or tap **Search**.

5. To view the user's personal data, double-click or double-tap the user's name.

    ![PowerApps User Form](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-user-form.png)

#### Audit history
When [audit tracking](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/audit-data-user-activity) is enabled for an entity in CDS for Apps, a user's personal data is logged in the audit history along with the actions that the user performs.

### Rectify
If a data subject asks you to rectify the personal data that resides in your organization’s data, you and your organization must determine whether it’s appropriate to honor the request. Rectifying data may include editing, redacting, or removing personal data from a document or other type of item.

You can use Azure Active Directory to manage the identities (personal data) of your users within CDS for Apps. Enterprise customers can manage DSR rectify requests by using the limited editing features within a given Microsoft service. As a data processor, Microsoft does not offer the ability to correct system-generated logs, because they reflect factual activities and constitute a historical record of events within Microsoft services. See [GDPR: Data Subject Requests (DSRs)](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRDSR) for details.

Once a user record is deleted from Azure Active Directory, System Administrators can then remove any remaining personal data related to that user (such as custom attributes) from all the instances.  

### Export

#### System user
You can export a user's personal data stored in the system User entity to Excel from the user list within the administration center.

From the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/), do the following:

1. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then select an environment from the list.

2. Click or tap **Dynamics 365 Administration Center**, select an environment from the list, and then click or tap **Open**.

## Personal data stored in databases of CDS for Apps

### Prerequisites
You may be storing personal data from individuals (such as your own customers) within your CDS for Apps entities.  

CDS System Administrators are responsible for maintaining an inventory of where personal data is being stored within various entities for each individual so that he or she can locate that data in response to any DSR requests.  

Personal data can then be exported, rectified, or deleted in an entity using the in-product functionality.  

### Discover
When CDS System Administrators receive a DSR request from an individual, they must identify which environments/CDS instances contain personal data for that individual. Personal data is typically stored in key entities (for example, Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, etc.), but it’s your responsibility to develop policies and procedures for maintaining an inventory of where you store each individual's personal data so you're prepared to respond to DSR requests.

Using an inventory, CDS System Administrators can configure the search entities and fields and then access the CDS for Apps environment to discover personal data. For more information, see [Configure Relevance Search](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872506).

From the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/), do the following:

1. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then select an environment from the list.

2. Click or tap **Dynamics 365 Administration Center**, select an environment from the list, click or tap the search button, and then click or tap **Relevance Search**.

    ![PowerApps Relevance Search Menu](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-relevance-search-menu.png)

3. Enter the individual’s personal data in the search box, and then click or tap **Search**.

    ![PowerApps Relevance Search Results](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-relevance-search-results.png)

### Rectify
CDS System Administrators can update an individual’s personal data by using the list of results from the  Relevance Search. However, an individual’s personal data may also be stored in other custom entities. CDS System Administrators are responsible for maintaining an inventory of these other custom entities and making the appropriate updates to an individual’s personal data.

From the Relevance Search results, do the following:

1. Click or tap an item that contains the individual's personal data.

2. Update the individual's personal data where appropriate, and then click or tap **Save**.

    ![PowerApps Account details](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-account-details.png)

### Export
You can take a screenshot of the data and share it with your DSR requestor.

From the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/), do the following:

1. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then select an environment from the list.

2. Click or tap **Dynamics 365 Administration Center**, select an environment from the list, click or tap the search button, and then click or tap **Relevance Search**.

    ![PowerApps Relevance Search Menu](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-relevance-search-menu.png)

3. Enter the individual’s personal data in the search box, and then click or tap **Search**.

    ![PowerApps Relevance Search Results](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-relevance-search-results.png)

4. Double-click the item in the search results list.

5. Press Alt+PrtScn to take the screenshot.

6. Save the screenshot to a file, which you can then send to the DSR requestor.

### Delete
CDS System Administrators can delete an individual’s personal data from records where that data is stored.  The CDS System Administrator can choose to either delete the record where the personal data is stored, or remove the contents of the personal data from the record.  

> [!NOTE]
> CDS administrators can customize an environment to prevent a record from being deleted from an entity. If configured in this way, you'll have to remove the contents of the personal data from the record rather than delete the record itself.

From the Relevance Search results, to the following:

1. Click or tap an item that contains the individual's personal data.

2. In the ribbon, click or tap **Delete**. (Note that **Delete** is disabled if the record cannot be deleted).

    ![PowerApps Account delete](./media/common-data-service-gdpr-dsr-guide/powerapps-account-delete.png)

## Personal data stored in databases of the previous version of CDS

### Prerequisites
You may be storing personal data from individuals (such as your own customers) within your CDS entities.  

CDS System Administrators are responsible for maintaining an inventory of where personal data is being stored within various entities for each individual so that he or she can locate that data in response to any DSR requests.  

Personal data can then be exported, rectified, or deleted in an entity using the in-product functionality.  

### Discover
When CDS System Administrators receives a DSR request from an individual, they must identify which environments/CDS instances contain personal data from that individual. Personal data is typically stored in key entities (for example, Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, etc.), but it’s your responsibility to develop policies and procedures for maintaining an inventory of where you store each individual's personal data so you're prepared to respond to DSR requests.

You can find personal data from users of the previous version of CDS within the following resources:

|Resource | Purpose | Website access |	Programmatic access
| --- | --- | --- | ---
|Entity records	| Captures business transactions in the respective business entity. | [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) |  	No

#### Entity records
An individual's personal data can be stored in any business entity.

This version of the CDS contains its own database schema and infrastructure. It has its own entities, and you manage these entities in [PowerApps](http://web.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

To see a list of your entities, do the following:

1. In the **Environment** drop-down list, select your environment.

8. Using your inventory list, repeat the above steps for each of the business entities to discover all of the individual's personal data.

### Rectify
If a data subject asks you to rectify the personal data that resides in your organization’s data, you and your organization must determine whether it’s appropriate to honor the request. Rectifying data may include editing, redacting, or removing personal data from a document or other type of item.

You can use Azure Active Directory to manage the identities (personal data) of your users within the previous version of CDS. Enterprise customers can manage DSR rectify requests by using the limited editing features within a given Microsoft service. As a data processor, Microsoft does not offer the ability to correct system-generated logs, because they reflect factual activities and constitute a historical record of events within Microsoft services. See [GDPR: Data Subject Requests (DSRs)](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRDSR) for details.

To rectify personal data that resides in the CDS environment, you can export the entity data into an Excel spreadsheet, update it, and then import the updates back to the database.

CDS System Administrators are responsible for identifying all entities that contain personal data for an individual and repeating the following steps for each of those entities.
