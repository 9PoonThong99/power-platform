## Limited Preview: Report outage
For now, we're rolling out a new Preview feature to a limited set of customers to try out. If you're experiencing a service outage, we want your support request to get more timely review and action. Select the **Report outage** link to report the outage. If you don't see this link, don't worry! We'll be bringing this feature to all customers in the future.
