## Architecture
Itâ€™s best to familiarize oneself with Environments as the first step to building the right governance story for your company. Environments are the containers for all resources utilized by a PowerApps, Microsoft Flow and Common Data Service for Apps. [Environments Overview](environments-overview.md) is a good primer which should be followed by [Common Data Service for Apps](wp-cds-for-apps.md), [Types of PowerApps](wp-types-powerapps.md), [Microsoft Flow](wp-about-flows.md), [Connectors](wp-connectors.md),  and [On-premises Gateways](wp-onpremises-gateway.md).
