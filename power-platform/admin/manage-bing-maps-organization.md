 The following table contains a list of all languages supported in [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps for viewing [!INCLUDE[pn_bing](../includes/pn-bing.md)] maps. If the language is listed, the [!INCLUDE[pn_bing](../includes/pn-bing.md)] map is shown on the form, such as account, contact or lead, in your language. If the language is not listed, the map is not shown on the form. Instead, the link **Click here to view the map** is provided on the form.
