# Plan for deployment and administration

Your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps deployment will go more smoothly with some preliminary planning.  The following table lists some of the items to consider before you start the actual deployment process.

Identify current [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps data that you would like to bring into Dynamics 365 apps, and your overall data storage requirements. Include a business requirements analysis that describes your organization’s expectation or requirements for a service level agreement (SLA). An SLA is an agreement between two or more parties describing the deliverables, support, and communication that each party will provide to the other. Specify your policies related to security and privacy.                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                             Is there enough overlap in customers and products across business units to be able to work in the same [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps data? What type of security policy does the organization already have in place? Are there any special requirements in this area? Is there a plan for business growth that could affect the number of users of Dynamics 365 apps?<br /><br /> Plan for enough time to do this discovery; information that comes out of this exercise can affect the way you implement the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

For example, implementing single sign-on for Dynamics 365 apps in an organization’s network environment means that after a user signs in to the network, that user does not have to enter credentials again when accessing Dynamics 365 apps. **Note:**  For [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscribers, Customer Engagement instance must be in the same tenant as your [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription.

| Administrative roles in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)] |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        A number of administrative roles are available to assign to users if you manage your subscription in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)]. Administrative roles define administrative responsibilities related to subscription management activities, for example, billing administration, password administration, and user management administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                           Consider the available administrative roles and the needs of your environment to identify the roles you want to use and the users you will choose for each role. The global administrator role is the highest level role, having all the permissions to manage any part of the subscription process. We recommend that you assign this role to more than one person so that someone is always available to manage all aspects of the subscription. **Note:**  Administrative roles cover all subscription management functions within the service. These aren’t the same as the security roles that you assign to users in Dynamics 365 apps, which are required and govern access to resources in the Dynamics 365 apps service. See “Security roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps” in this table.                                            |

Review the documentation associated with each product update before you enable it in a production environment. Additionally, some product updates, such as the sales and service process forms, can’t be removed or easily reverted to the previous functionality. Therefore, you should give careful consideration before you enable a product update. **Tip:**  If you’re unsure whether you want to enable a product update in a Customer Engagement instance used in production, sign up for a trial subscription to evaluate the new functionality.
