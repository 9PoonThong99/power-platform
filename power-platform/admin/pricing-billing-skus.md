# Licensing overview

## About PowerApps licenses

- PowerApps is licensed on a per-user basis. 
- User licenses are assigned on a named user basis, each user needs a separate license to run apps. 
- PowerApps licenses do not limit the creation of apps.
- Any PowerApps license is eligible to administer apps. 
- PowerApps is available with two standalone plans—PowerApps Plan 1 and PowerApps Plan 2. 
- PowerApps Plan 1 provides access to Common Data Service to store and manage data. Users can run canvas apps that are built on Common Data Service, use premium connectors, access data in custom applications or on-premises data. 
- PowerApps Plan 2 allows users to run model-driven apps with code plug-ins and real-time workflows. For details please visit the [PowerApps pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).  
- For details please visit the [PowerApps pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/) or download the [Licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130). 
- In addition to the standalone plans PowerApps capabilities are also included in certain Office 365 and Dynamics 365 plans allowing customers to extend and customize Office 365 and Dynamics 365 with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow capabilities that these offerings include.

## Resource capacity is included with each license

### Default subscription capacity  

PowerApps Plan 1 and Plan 2 licenses include capacities of one of more of these resources. PowerApps and Microsoft Flow subscription capacity leverages the same tenant and infrastructure and accrue across one tenant. 

|Default capacity per tenant   |PowerApps Plan 1   |PowerApps Plan 2   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Common Data Service Database capacity      | 1 GB         | 10 GB         |
|Common Data Service File capacity      | 20 GB         | 20 GB         |
|Common Data Service Log capacity      | 2 GB         | 2 GB         |

Per-user licenses come with included capacity for resources used when an app or flow is executed. These resources include data storage management and flow runs. The capacities included in the per-user licenses are pooled at the tenant level and, when the tenant’s capacity is exhausted, customers may purchase additional capacity through add-on licenses. For every increment of PowerApps or Flow user subscription licenses, the included database and file capacity increases, see table. The cap on the amount of database capacity that may be earned or purchased per tenant is subject to the technical limit of 4TB/instance, no maximum on file or log capacity.

### Accrued entitlements per user subscription license 

|Default capacity per tenant   |PowerApps Plan 1   |PowerApps Plan 2   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Common Data Service Database capacity      | 20 MB         | 250 MB         |
|Common Data Service File capacity      | n/a          | 2 GB          |
|Common Data Service Log capacity      | n/a          | n/a         |
|Flow Runs per user/month     | 4,500      | 15,000      |

> [!NOTE]
> We’ve removed the requirement to purchase additional production or non-production environments for Common Data Service. New environments can be created when at least 1 GB of database capacity is available. To learn how to create new production or non-production instances, see [Provision an environment](provision-environment.md).

### Capacity add-ons 

When the tenant’s capacity is exhausted, customers may purchase additional capacity through add-on licenses. Subscription add-ons apply across tenant and are not tied to a specific user. Subscription add-ons can be purchased at any time and remain a part of the subscription for the remainder of the subscription term.    

|Add-on capacity per tenant/month   |  |Maximum per tenant    |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Common Data Service Database capacity      | $40/GB        | 4TB/environment        |
|Common Data Service File capacity      | $2/GB        | n/a         |
|Common Data Service Log capacity      | $10/GB          | n/a         |
