# Provision an environment

How you provision an environment depends on the platform you're working in.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are working to enable provisioning environments within the Power Platform Admin center. Check back for updated information.
>
> If you purchased the new capacity-based license, until provisioning environments is available through the Power Platform Admin center, you can provision environments through the PowerApps/Flow/Dynamics 365 Admin center. If you still need more environments, you can contact [Support](get-help-support.md).

## Provision an environment for PowerApps

See [Create an environment](create-environment.md).

## Provision an environment for Microsoft Flow

See [Create an environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/environments-overview-admin#create-an-environment).

## Provision an environment for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement

Until provisioning is enabled in the Power Platform Admin center, you provision environments (instances) in the Dynamics 365 Administration Center.

You can get to this center in multiple ways.

- **Sign in directly**: See [Direct sign in to the Dynamics 365 Administration Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/sign-in-office-365-apps#direct-sign-in-to-the-dynamics-365-administration-center)
- **Select Dynamics 365 (Power Platform)**: In the [Power Platform Admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/), in the left-side menu, expand **Admin centers** and select **Dynamics 365**.
- **Select Dynamics 365 (Microsoft 365)**: In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), in the left-side menu, expand **Admin centers** and select **Dynamics 365**. You might need to select **All admin centers** to display the **Dynamics 365** tile. 

For information on how to provision an environment (instance) in the Dynamics 365 Administration Center, see [Add an instance to your subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/add-instance-subscription).
