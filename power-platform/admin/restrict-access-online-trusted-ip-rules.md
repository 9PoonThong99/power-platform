# Restrict access with trusted IP rules

You can limit access to users with trusted IP addresses to reduce unauthorized access. When trusted IP address restrictions are set in a userâ€™s profile and the user tries to log in from an untrusted IP address, access to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, are blocked.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
- A subscription to [Azure Active Directory Premium](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/azure-active-directory).  
  
- A federated [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] tenant. See [Azure AD conditional access and federated authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview#azure-ad-conditional-access-and-federated-authentication).
  
- Federated tenants require that multi-factor authentication (MFA) be enabled.

## Additional security considerations  
 IP restriction is only enforced during user authentication.  This is done by the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] Conditional Access capability. Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 set a session timeout limit to balance protecting user data and the number of times users are prompted for their sign-in credentials. Trusted IP restriction for devices (including laptops) is not applied until the session timeout expires.  
  
 For example, a trusted IP restriction is setup to only allow access to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 when users are working from a corporate office.  When a user signs in into model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 using their laptop from their office and establishes a session, the user can continue to access model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 after leaving the office until the session timeout expires.  This behavior also applies to mobile and offsite connections such as: Dynamics 365 for Phones and Tablets, and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)].

## Create a security group (optional)  
You can restrict access to all Users or groups of users.  It's more efficient to restrict by a group if only a subset of your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users are accessing model-driven apps in Dynamics 365.  

For information, see: [Create a basic group and add members using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal).

## Create a location based restriction
Access restriction is set using Azure Active Directory (AD) Conditional Access and the Trusted IPs feature of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. 

See:
- [Getting started with conditional access to Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-conditional-access-azuread-connected-apps/)
- [Trusted IPs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#trusted-ips)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Setting Conditional Access is only available with an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] Premium license.  Upgrade your Azure AD to a Premium license in the Microsoft 365 admin center (**<https://admin.microsoft.com>** > **Billing** > **Purchase services**).
