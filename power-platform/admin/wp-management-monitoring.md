# Management and monitoring

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In this section we will focus on the tools you can use to manage and monitor what is going on in your environments. Tooling falls into the following three categories:
Portals offer an interactive experience for performing administrative tasks. This is typically considered the primary path for completing administrative activities. From a monitoring point of view this channel is used mostly for ad hoc interactive discovery.

PowerShell cmdlets offer a way to automate both management and monitoring tasks using PowerShell. These cmdlets can be used in a sequence to automate multi-step administrative actions.

Connectors offer the ability to use the platformâ€™s own tools to manage and monitor itself. The Flow Management connector is specifically designed to help with administrative management and monitoring. But you can also use any of the other 200+ connectors and approval process capabilities to automate your own admin work.
