# Online Management API (REST) to manage environments

The Online Management API is a REST API that lets you create and manage Common Data Service environments in your Office 365 tenant. As application publishers or ISVs, you can use the Online Management API to:

* Automate the creation of custom demo Common Data Service environments.
* Manage multiple Common Data Service environments, in case your enterprise includes multiple organizations.<!--Edit okay?-->

Using the Online Management API, you can perform various tasks on your environment such as create, retrieve, delete, backup and restore environments, and other environment-related tasks. More information:
