# Solution Packager tool

Solution Packager is a tool that can reversibly decompose a Common Data Service compressed solution file into multiple XML and other files, so that these files can be easily managed by a source control system. The Solution Packager tool is included in the [Power Apps build tools](devops-build-tools.md) package. More information: [SolutionPackager tool](../developer/common-data-service/compress-extract-solution-file-solutionpackager.md)

For information about using the tool with source control, see [Source control with solution files](../developer/common-data-service/use-source-control-solution-files.md).
