# Update a solution 

Make changes to your unmanaged solution, such as adding or removing components.
Then, when you import a managed solution that was previously imported, the
import logic detects the solution as an update and displays the following screen of options.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Solution update detected upon import](media/solution-update-alm.png "Solution update detected upon import")
