# Feedback and support

While the underlying features and components used to build the kit (such as Common Data Service, Admin APIs, and Connectors) are fully supported, the kit itself represents sample implementations of these features that our customers and community can use and customize to implement admin and governance capabilities in their organization.

If you face issues with:

- **Using the kit**, report your issue here: [aka.ms/coe-starter-kit-issues](https://aka.ms/coe-starter-kit-issues). (Microsoft Support won't help you with issues related to this kit, but they do help with related underlying platform and feature issues.)
- **The core features in Power Platform**, use your standard channel to contact Microsoft Support.
