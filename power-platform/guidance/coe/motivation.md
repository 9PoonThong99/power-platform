# Motivation

Establishing a Microsoft Power Platform CoE means investing in and nurturing organic growth while maintaining governance and control. A CoE is designed to drive innovation and improvement, and through its central function can break down geographic and organizational silos in order to bring together like minded people with similar business goals to share knowledge and success, whilst at the same time providing standards, consistency, and governance to the organization. In summary, a CoE can be a powerful way for an organization to align around business goals rather than individual department metrics.

A key principle is to clarify why you're setting up a CoE, what you aim to accomplish and the key business outcomes you hope to achieve. Then get started and learn and evolve along the way. For many, the CoE is a first step in fostering greater creativity and innovation across the organization by empowering business units to digitize and automate their business processes, while maintaining the necessary level of central oversight and governance.

The CoE Starter Kit is a template that might not match every organization's requirements, so it's recommended that you extend the solution to fit your organization's requirements defined by your CoE.

## Philosophy

A Power Platform Center of Excellence is a group in an organization that takes ownership of the Power Platform administration, nurturing and operations support. Part of devising a strategy for this requires interaction with the platform directly.
Follow this process when thinking about the medium in which a Center of Excellence strategy should be executed:

   :::column span="":::
      **Admin Center** The core, most important capabilities for admins and makers exist in the supported product portal features. These features are designed to be the easiest and most robust way to complete tasks, and are fully supported by the engineering team:
      - Environment and Environment Security management
      - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy management
      - Data integration and Gateway management
      - Admin Analytics (to view Capacity and activity on CDS, PowerApps and Flow)
      - Support ticket requests

      The admin centers include:
      - [Power Platform Admin Center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/)
      - [Power Apps Admin Center](https://admin.powerapps.com/home)
      - [Power Automate Admin Center](https://admin.flow.microsoft.com/)
      - [Dynamics 365 Admin Center](https://port.crm.dynamics.com/)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
       **Platform extensions** There are four connectors that provide access to the same APIs that the out-of-box product use. These have been exposed through the connectors library to give users the ability to create custom solutions to execute administrative or governance related tasks.

       - [PowerApps for Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforadmins/)
       - [Flow Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/flowmanagement/)
       - [PowerApps for App Makers](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforappmakers/)
   :::column-end:::
    :::column span="":::
      **Templates & customizations.** The CoE starter kit falls into this category, which is a set of templates that use the admin connectors in combination with other connectors and formulas to achieve some specified goal. The nature of a template is to provide a good solution for that specific task, but it might not have the exact functionality that everyone needs and could require adjustment to achieve what others might be looking for. It is better to first explore the other two options before instantiating a template, unless it's clear that the template has everything you need from the start.
