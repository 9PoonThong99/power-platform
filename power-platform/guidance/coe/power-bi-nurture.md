# Nurture

As you establish your Center of Excellence, a significant part of your activity will be nurturing your maker community, enabling them to follow best practices, and working together with them to identify whether they or their resources need additional support.

The Nurture section helps you find your "star" app and flow makers and see what connectors they're using, where they're based (department/city/country) and how they're adopting Power Platform.

## Makers

The **Maker page**, at one glance, helps you see your top makers, how many apps and flows those makers have created and your top active departments.

## App Gurus

The **App Gurus** page gives you an overview of which makers are using which connectors. Makers with a high usage of different connectors are likely more
advanced and could turn into your champions; makers who use only Office
connectors are likely at the beginning of their journey and might need a helping
hand.

## Flow Gurus

The **Flow Gurus** page gives you an overview of how many actions and connectors
per flow your makers are using. Makers with complex flows that have multiple
actions or use multiple connectors are likely more advanced and could turn into
your champions; makers who use very few connectors or mostly template flows are
likely at the beginning of their journey and might need a helping hand.

## App Shares

The **App Shares** page shows your top apps (by number of users it is shared
with and number of app launches), as well as your users who most frequently launch Power
Apps.
