# CoE Starter Kit explained

The CoE Starter Kit is shipped in multiple modules:

1. **Center of Excellence – Core Components**  
    These components provide the core to get started with setting up a CoE –
    they sync all your resources into entities and build admin apps on top of
    that to help you get more visibility of what apps, flows and makers are in
    your environment. Additionally, apps like the DLP Editor and Set New App
    Owner help with daily admin tasks.  
    
    The Core Components solution contains assets relevant only to admins.
    Learn how to [set up the core components](setup-core-components.md) and how to [use the core components](core-components.md).

1. **Center of Excellence – Governance Components**  
    Once you are familiar with your environments and resources, you might start
    thinking about audit and compliance processes for your apps. You might want
    to gather additional information about your apps from your makers, or you might
    want to audit specific connectors or app usage; the apps and flows part of this solution help you get started.  
    
    The Audit and Report Components solution contains assets relevant to admins and makers.
    Learn how to [set up the governance components](setup-governance-components.md) and how to [use the governance components](governance-components.md).

1. **Center of Excellence – Nurture Components**  
    An essential part of establishing a CoE is nurturing your makers and an
    internal community. You will want to share best practices and templates and
    onboard new makers; the assets part of this solution can help develop a
    strategy for this motion.  
    
    The Nurture Components solution contains assets relevant to everyone in the organization: admins, makers as well as end users of apps and flows.
    Learn how to [set up the nurture components](setup-nurture-components.md) and how to [use the nurture components](nurture-components.md).

We recommend getting started and familiar with the Center of Excellence – Core
components before adding the Governance and Nurture components.
