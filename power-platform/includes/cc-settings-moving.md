> Getting to app feature settings can vary based on the type of Dynamics 365 app (Unified Interface or the legacy web client) you're using. You might need to adjust the procedural steps in this topic to reflect your app type. See [Settings in Dynamics 365 apps](../admin/admin-settings.md#settings-in-dynamics-365-apps).

> Also, we are moving some settings from Dynamics 365 apps and the Dynamics 365 Admin center to the Power Platform Admin center. See [Environment settings are moving](../admin/admin-settings.md#environment-settings-are-moving).
