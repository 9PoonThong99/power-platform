[**Items**](../maker/canvas-apps/controls/properties-core.md) The source of data that appears in a control such as a gallery, a list, or a chart.

<p style="margin-left: 2.0em">When you add a gallery, a list, or a chart, the property list shows **Items** by default so that you can easily specify the data that the new control should show. For example, you might set the **Items** property of a gallery to the **Account** table in Salesforce, a table named **Inventory** that you created in Excel and uploaded to the cloud, or a SharePoint list named **ConferenceSpeakers**.
