[**Reset**](properties-data.md) A Boolean (**true**/**false**) value that determines whether a control reverts to its default value.

<p style="margin-left: 2.0em">For example, set the **OnSelect**  property of a button so that, when the user selects it, the value of a context variable is changed to **true**. Then set the **Reset** property of another control, such as a list, to the name of the context variable. By taking this approach, the list would revert to its default value whenever the user selects the button.
