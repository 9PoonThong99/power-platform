# View billed sessions for Power Virtual Agents

- definition (move it here from the admin page. Link from the admin page here)

- they are not actually charged
- there is currently no way to see billed sessions across the entire tenant, but it is on our roadmap



You can download a maximum of seven days of sessions from the past 30 days. If your bot had a high number of sessions, they will be broken down into multiple rows, each containing 2500 sessions. 

Click on each row to download the sessions for the specified timeframe.
