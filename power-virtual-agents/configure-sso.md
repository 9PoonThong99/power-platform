# Configure Single Sign-on with Azure Active Directory in Power Virtual Agents

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Power Virtual Agents enables you to author personalized conversations and perform actions on behalf of your users. With single sign-on support, bots can be configured to automatically sign-in the user if the user has already signed into the page where bot is deployed (e.g. Coporate Intranet, Applications, etc.)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Before using this feature, you must follow the [end-user authentication configuration instructions](configuration-end-user-authentication.md) and [deploy a custom canvas](extend-custom-canvas-connect.md)

## Overview
The following illustration gives you an overview of how Single Sign-on works end-to-end.

[Illustration goes here]

1. 

## Create an app registration in Azure Active Directory

## Update your custom canvas to intercept sign-in prompts

## Compliance considerations
Security and privacy considerations - scope, token caching, etc.
