# Add Facebook channel

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can publish your bot to your Facebook app so that it uses the Facebook Messenger experience on Facebook pages that you specify.

You need a Facebook app, and an associated developer account, to connect your Power Virtual Agents bot to Facebook. 

## Configure Facebook and Power Virtual Agents

There are a number of steps involved in this process:

1. Configure Facebook app settings: retrieve your app Facebook app information, enable API access, add Facebook Messenger to your app, and configure the Facebook pages your app should appear on
2. Configure the Facebook publication channel in Power Virtual Agents
3. Connect your Facebook app to Power Virtual Agents (by using webhooks)

You will then need to submit your app for Facebook review before you can publish your app and either make it public or, if you have a Facebook Workplace account (which is the business-to-employee version of Facebook), you can also deploy your bot there. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This article is intended for experienced IT professionals who manage your organization's Facebook page and Facebook Workplace.

>[!NOTE]
>By publishing your bot to a Facebook page, some of your data, such as bot content and end user chat content, will be shared with Facebook (meaning that your data will flow outside of your [organizationâ€™s compliance and geographic or regional boundaries](data-location.md).
>For more information, see [Facebook's Platform Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy-overview).

Facebook Messenger, Facebook Workplace, and related services are subject to Facebook's own terms and conditions.  For support related to Facebook Messenger and Facebook Workplace, please contact Facebook directly.

### Submit for Facebook review

You need to submit your app for Facebook review before you can make your Facebook app public.  Facebook requires a Privacy Policy URL and Terms of Service URL.  You need to provide those on the Facebook basic app settings page (after logging into your app at [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/), select **Basic** under **Settings** on the side menu panel).

The [Code of Conduct](https://investor.fb.com/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct/default.aspx) page contains third-party resources to help create a privacy policy. The [Terms of Use](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) page contains sample terms to help create an appropriate Terms of Service document.

Facebook has its own [review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review) for apps that are published to Messenger. You can learn more about it at [Sample submissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/sample-submissions/) and [Common rejection reasons](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/common-rejection-reasons/). Your bot will be tested to ensure it is compliant with [Facebook's Platform Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy-overview) before approved by Facebook to become public. 

### Make the app public and publish the page
Until the app is published, it is in [Development Mode](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/managing-development-cycle). The bot will not be public and only work for admins, developers, and testers.

After the review is successful, in the App Dashboard under App Review, set the app to **Public**. Ensure that the Facebook Page associated with this bot is published. The status appears in **Pages** settings.

## Add bot to Facebook Workplace
[Facebook Workplace](https://workplace.facebook.com/help/work/) is the business-to-employee version of Facebook.

To add your bot to Facebook Workplace you will need information from your Facebook Workplace Advanced account and Power Virtual Agents. You also need to be the administrator of a Facebook Workplace Advanced account to create a custom integration. Learn more at [What are the differences between Workplace Standard and Workplace Advanced?](https://www.facebook.com/help/work/289530281467090) and [Facebook Workplace Custom Integrations](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/custom-integrations-new/).

**Create and connect a custom integration:**

1. Sign in to your [Facebook Workplace Advanced](https://www.facebook.com/workplace) account as the administrator.

2. Select **Admin Panel** on the side menu panel and then **Integrations**. Select **Create Custom Integration**.
![Create custom integration](media/channel-fb-wp-custom-integration.png)

3. Under **Integration details**, copy and securely store the *App ID*, *App Secret* and *Access Token* (the *Access token* will be used as the page access token). Make sure **Enabled** is set to **Yes**. Under **Integrations Permissions**, make sure **Message any member** is seleted.

![Get Facebook Workplace custom integration info](media/channel-fb-wp-get-integration-info.png)

4. Navigate to the custom integration page you created in the previous step. You can do this by searching the custom integration's name on the side search bar. Copy the *page ID* of the custom integration from the URL at *my.workplace.com/\{your-integration-name}-\{pageID}/*.
